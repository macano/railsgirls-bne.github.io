Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

By now you should have received an email invite to use Cloud 9. The image below is a sample only :)

The link will take you to the Cloud 9 website and from here you should use your github credentials (created in the first step above) to 
login. Simply click on the github icon (see below)

Once you have signed up, you will be shown your dashboard. __Create a New workspace__ by clicking the green plus icon.

Name your new workspace _railsgirls_, and make sure you are creating a Ruby workspace. Then click 'Create workspace'.

You will then be taken directly to your new workspace.

## Upgrading to Rails Version 5
By default Cloud9 comes with rails version 4 installed. But there is a newer version of Rails available and at Rails Girls
we like to stay ahead of the game. Lets upgrade our environment to Rails 5

These steps can be a little tricky so if you are unsure just ask a mentor for help. Lets get started

1. Ensure your cursor is in the bash window (also known as terminal window, see the screen shot below) and type `cd ..` This command will ensure we are
in the root of the project and not inside our workspace folder. This folder will contain our app but we don't need to be in it to do our rails version install.

1. When ready type `gem install rails`

2. When completed type `sudo apt-get update` this will ensure we have the latest packages

3. Next type `rails new rails5-proj` this will be a temp project, we will remove it a bit later

4. Then enter `mv workspace workspace.bck` here we are taking a backup of our workspace (its the workspace with the old version of Rails and we don't really need it again but generally it's safer to rename a directory than deleting especially when you are learning)

5. Enter `mkdir workspace` here we are making a new workspace, this will be for our Rails 5 version. The Blog App that we are about to build will be contained within the workspace folder.

6. Enter `cd rails5-proj` this will  move you into the **rails5-proj** directory

7. Then `cp -r  * ../workspace` here we are simply copying everything into our new workspace directory (this is the Rails 5 one)

8. Type `cd ..` to simply move up one level in the directory structure and then type `ls` to see a list of the files in the current directory. It should be similar to this

9. You should see a folder called  **rails5-proj** we are going to remove it now, simply type `rm -rf rails5-proj`

10. Finally move into the workspace folder so we can start building our Rails 5 app, type `cd workspace`

11. Let's type `bundle install` so we know all our gems are up to date (gems are basically libraries that contains pre-written code so that you don't have to write it from scratch)


## Workspace environment

<img src="/images/c9/c9-project-workspace-annotated.png"  width="600">

The workspace is made up of a few important areas.

- The file explorer and editor are where we will be spending a lot of time. Choose files to edit using the explorer. They will open in a new tab in the file editor.
- Run Project Button. We will use this to start and stop our Rails application.
- The Terminal is used to enter commands to our application.

## Set up the text editor

The Ruby global convention is to use 2 spaces for indentation. Lets change the default editor to use 2 spaces.

Click on the settings icon in the upper right side of the window. A preferences window will open edit the __Soft Tabs__ setting to reduce it to 2.

## Viewing your project in the Browser

From the ruby-railsgirls terminal you need to start the rails server. Click the 'Run Project' button.

Click on the share button in the top right window. From the __Share this workspace__ window click on the url in Application and select the open option

You may see the Cloud 9 preview page, if so click on the `Open the App` button
