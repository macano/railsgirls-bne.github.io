## What is Sinatra?
<img src="/images/sinatrawiki.png">

# Getting Started

## *1.* Creating the application with Cloud9

Follow the steps outlined in the Rails Girls Cloud9 Sinatra Setup Guide [Cloud9 Setup](/cloud9-sinatra-guide)

## *2.* Write a description for your application

Cloud9 automatically creates a file called `REAMDME.md`. The `.md` extension means that this is a MarkDown file.
A readme file is useful for documenting what your application does, and how a developer can setup their environment to develop or run your application.
There is no clearly defined Markdown standard, however, GitHub has their own [flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)(sic).

- [ ] Double click the `README.md` in the Cloud9 file explorer to open it.
- [ ] Replace the contents of the file with your description.
- [ ] Save the file.

eg.
```
# My awesome Sinatra app!
This app is like the RailsGirls Ideas app, but using Sinatra instead of Rails!
```

We will add more documentation as the project evolves.

## *3.* Git

While you are developing your app, you should be committing your changes and pushing them to a remote repository, such as GitHub.

We'll start by initialising git within our app and adding the current files.

- [ ] Run the git initialiser. To do this simply enter the command below into the terminal window in Cloud9

{% highlight sh %}
git init
{% endhighlight %}

- [ ] Commit the app to git

{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
{% endhighlight %}

You can modify the `Initial commit` message to anything you like.

The next step is to create a remote repository on GitHub and add it to your app.

- [ ] Log onto GitHub and start a project

<a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank"><img src="images/github_start_project.png" ></a>

- [ ] Give your repo a title and a description

<img src="/images/github_create_repo.png">

- [ ] Follow the instructions on GitHub under the heading `…or push an existing repository from the command line`

They will be similar to below. DO NOT copy the lines below. You must push to your own newly created repo

{% highlight sh %}
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourName/project_name.git
git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}

Whenever you wish to commit your changes to GitHub, enter the following(change the message!):
{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "Change this message to describe your changes!"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

# Start Coding

## *4.* Create a Gemfile

There are a few gems we will need to install before we can start coding. The easiest way to install gems is by using the [bundler](http://bundler.io) gem.
Simply run `gem install bundler` before proceeding.

Bundler uses a `Gemfile` to record which gems our app needs.
We need to manually create this `Gemfile` for our app. This can be done from the terminal window or the Cloud9 file explorer window.

To use the Cloud9 explorer window, right mouse-click and select `New file`. Rename this file from `Untitled` to `Gemfile`.

To use the terminal:
{% highlight sh %}
touch Gemfile
{% endhighlight %}

A `Gemfile` will now appear in the Cloud9 file explorer window. Double click to open it and type in the following code which specifies which gems we want included in our application:

{% highlight ruby %}
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem "sinatra"
gem "rake"
gem "sqlite3"
gem "activerecord"
gem "sinatra-activerecord"

group :development do
  gem "sinatra-contrib"
  gem "tux"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Save the `Gemfile` (`command ⌘ + s`(mac), `control + s`(windows and linux) or use the menu option `File -> Save`).

Commit your `Gemfile` to git:

{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "Created Gemfile"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

Any time you edit a `Gemfile` you must install the new gems. To do so, run the following command in the terminal window:

{% highlight sh %}
bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

To update your gems to their latest version, run:

{% highlight sh %}
bundle update
{% endhighlight %}

Commit the `Gemfile.lock` file:

{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "bundle install"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

### Quick Overview of the gems

**sinatra** allows us to use the Sinatra DSL (Domain Specific Language) in our app.

**rake** is used to run automated tasks, like creating and migrating the database.

**sqlite3** is the database we will be using to store data.

**activerecord** is the interface the app uses to communicate with the database.

**sinatra-activerecord** is a bridge that allows us to use Active Record in a Sinatra application.

**tux** allows us to interact with the database through the command line.

**sinatra-contrib** will reload our app, so we don't have to stop and start the server whenever a minor change is made.


## *5.* Project Structure

Sinatra doesn’t impose any structure on your project (which can be both a blessing and a curse). The entire structure of the project is in your hands and this flexibility can cause headaches. The structure outlined in this app is a pattern that can work well for many of your future Sinatra apps.

In the next section we will focus on file and folder creation. Pay particular attention to where you create files/folders. Ask an instructor if you are unsure.

### *5a.* File/Folder Creation

The instructions given will show you how to create files and folders through the terminal window. You can however create all files and folders by right clicking in the Cloud9 explorer window as we did above. If you feel comfortable with file and folder creation follow the structure in the image below and skip to the next section.

From the terminal create a folder called `app` by executing the following command:

{% highlight sh %}
mkdir app
{% endhighlight %}

Change to the `app` folder and create three subfolders:

{% highlight sh %}
cd app
mkdir models views controllers
{% endhighlight %}

You have just created a major component of our application's structure:

1. models (database communication)
2. views (what the end user sees)
3. controllers (lots of routes for our app)

From the terminal window, move up one level of the project structure and into the root of the project:

{% highlight sh %}
cd ..
{% endhighlight %}

First we will create a folder called `files`. This folder will contain the files that we upload from our app. Next we will create a folder called `config`. Then we will create a file called `application.rb` inside the newly created `config` folder. `application.rb` is the file that will load all the files needed by our application. Finally we will create a file called `database.yml` that will manage our database connections.

{% highlight sh %}
mkdir files
mkdir config
cd config
touch application.rb
touch database.yml
{% endhighlight %}

From the terminal window, move up one level of the project structure and into the root of the project. From here create another folder called `db`. This will store information about our sqlite3 database including our database migrations.
{% highlight sh %}
cd ..
mkdir db
{% endhighlight %}

We are almost there. The final step in our skeleton structure for our application is to create a `config.ru` file in the root of the project. The `config.ru` file is a convention that is required by certain deployment procedures and tools (like shotgun, tux, and Heroku). We also create a `Rakefile` to describe any automated tasks.

{% highlight sh %}
touch config.ru
touch Rakefile
{% endhighlight %}

Congratulations! You may not realise it yet but you have just created a solid basic structure for a Sinatra app that you can reuse time and time again.

By the time our application is complete, it should look similar to the folder structure below:

<img src="/images/sinatra_visual_tree.png">

### *5b.* Commit the skeleton to git

If you wish to commit this skeleton folder structure to git, you may notice that the empty folders we created aren't being committed; git will only remember files, not folders. To make git remember our structure, you must create a file inside each empty folder. The convention is to create a file called `.keep`. The dot at the start of the name means that your computers operating system should ignore them.

{% highlight sh %}
touch app/.keep
touch app/controllers/.keep
touch app/models/.keep
touch app/views/.keep
touch db/.keep
touch files/.keep

git add .
git commit -m "folder structure"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

## *6.* Configure the App

The first step is to set up the `application.rb` file. Double click on the file to open it (you will find it under the `config` folder). Take some time to understand what we are about to put into this file.
Note you must save all files in cloud9 (`command ⌘ + s`(mac), `control + s`(windows and linux) or menu options `File -> Save`)

{% highlight sh %}
# require gems and classes
require 'bundler'
Bundler.require
$: << File.expand_path('../', __FILE__)
Dir['./app/**/*.rb'].sort.each { |file| require file }

# configure sinatra
set :root, Dir['./app']
set :public_folder, Proc.new { File.join(root, 'assets') }
set :erb, :layout => :'layouts/application'

{% endhighlight %}

Lets examine the first four lines in a bit more detail:

`require 'bundler'` enables our application to automatically discover the `Gemfile`.

`Bundler.require` loads into the project all the gems that are specified in the `Gemfile`.

`$: << File.expand_path('../', __FILE__)` adds the entire project to $LOAD_PATH. This allows Sinatra to find all the files you’ve added to the project.
For more on $LOAD_PATH read the [Rails Girls Brisbane blog post](http://www.railsgirlsbne.com/2017/02/05/load_path/)


Dir['./app/\*\*/\*.rb'].sort.each { \|file\| require file } This line explicitly requires each file found in our model, view and controller folders.

Even though we haven't set them up yet, we know the project is going to need these files.
The last three lines of `application.rb` sets the root of the project and tells the application where the erb (embedded Ruby) files and CSS files are located.

### *6a.* Rake

We need to set up our Rake file so we can run our helper tasks. Open the file `Rakefile` and add the following code:
{% highlight sh %}
require './config/application'
require 'sinatra/activerecord/rake'
{% endhighlight %}

### *6b.* ActiveRecord
The final step in our setup is the `database.yml` file. This file will contain our sqlite database configuration and is required for connecting to the database. Open the config folder and double click to open the file. Copy and paste the lines below.

{% highlight sh %}
sqlite: &sqlite
  host: 127.0.0.1
  adapter: sqlite3

development:
  <<: *sqlite
  database: db/development.sqlite3

production:
  <<: *sqlite
  database: db/production.sqlite3

test:
  <<: *sqlite
  database: db/test.sqlite3
{% endhighlight %}

### *6c.* Commit your setup

{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "Setup and configuration"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

## *7.* Migrations

Just like we did in the original Rails Girls, we need to create an `ideas` table so we can save our ideas. From the terminal window run:
{% highlight sh %}
rake db:create_migration NAME=create_ideas
{% endhighlight %}

A migration file will have been created in the `db/migrate` folder. The name of the file is of the form `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_ideas.rb`. The timestamp determines which migration should be run and in what order. Double-click to open it and enter the following. This is similar to the scaffold command you ran in Rails Girls.

{% highlight sh %}
class CreateIdeas < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :ideas do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.text :description
      t.string :picture

      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Each time we create a migration, it needs to be run so that the changes get applied to the database. Open the terminal window and type:

{% highlight sh %}
bundle exec rake db:migrate
{% endhighlight %}

This will create the `ideas` table inside the `db/development.sqlite3` database. You can see it in the schema file, `db/schema.rb`.

### *7a.* Commit your migration and schema, Ignore the database

Because our database might contain sensitive or private data, we do not want to commit it to `git`. `git` will ignore any files listed in a `.gitignore` file.

Create the `.gitignore` file using the Cloud9 file explorer or through terminal:
{% highlight sh %}
touch .gitignore
{% endhighlight %}

Cloud9 will sometimes hide files starting with a dot, but we need to see it.
Click the "cog" icon in the upper right corner of the file explorer to open the Cloud9 preferences tab. Under `User Settings` select `Tree & Navigate` and removed the `.*` from the `hidden file patterns` options. If unsure ask an instructor.

Open the `.gitignore` file and enter the following, to ignore all sqlite3 databases.
{% highlight sh %}
*.sqlite3
{% endhighlight %}

Now commit everything to `git`

{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "database migration and .gitignore"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

## *8.* Project Code
We have just created the ideas table by running the migration, so let's now create the corresponding model. Navigate to the `app/models` folder and create the `idea.rb` file (right click in cloud9 file explorer window or use the terminal window). We will use the terminal window.

{% highlight sh %}
touch app/models/idea.rb
{% endhighlight %}

Double click to open the file and enter the following code:

{% highlight sh %}
class Idea < ActiveRecord::Base

end
{% endhighlight %}

This is just an empty file at this stage, we will add code to it later on.

## *9.* Routes
Finally it is time to create routes. Routes are simply the rules that tell your application which code to run for a given URL. From the `controllers` folder, create a file called `ideas_controller.rb` (you can use the terminal window or cloud9 file explorer)

{% highlight sh %}
%w(/ /ideas).each do |path|
  get path do
    @ideas = Idea.all
    erb :'ideas/index'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

This route will map the URL `ideas/index` to a listing of all ideas. We have just told Sinatra to look in the ideas folder for an html file called `index.erb` (it has a `.erb` suffix rather than `.html` because it contains embedded Ruby as well as html).

Now that we have created our route we now need to create a corresponding index page to display it. Create a folder for `ideas` in the `app/views/` directory (from terminal window `mkdir app/views/ideas` or use the cloud9 file explorer window). Then create a file called `index.erb`.

## *10.* Views
Type or paste the following into the `index.erb` file you just created

{% highlight sh %}
<h1>Listing Ideas</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Picture</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
  <% @ideas.each do |idea| %>
    <tr>
      <td><%= idea.name %></td>
      <td><%= idea.description %></td>
      <td><%= idea.picture.present? %></td>
      <td><a href="/ideas/<%= idea.id %>/edit">Edit</a></td>
      <td><a href="/ideas/<%= idea.id %>">Show</a></td>
      <td><% if idea.picture %><a href="/files/<%= idea.picture %>">View Picture</a><% end %></td>
      <td><% if idea.picture %><a href="/files/<%= idea.picture %>/download">Download Picture</a><% end %></td>
    </tr>
  <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
{% endhighlight %}

### *10a.* Commit your ideas model, controller and view
{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "Ideas model, controller and view"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

## *11.* Improving our design

Although our application currently has only one page, it will eventually have many pages. To give it a consistent look and feel, we will want to have the same header and footer on each page. Instead of copying and pasting the header and footer onto each page,
and having to edit each page if we want to make a change, we will create one file that will contain all the common page content. This is an example of adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle of Ruby programming.

Create a subfolder of `views` folder and call it `layouts`. Then create a file in the `layouts` folder and call it `application.erb`.

Enter the following html/erb code:
{% highlight sh %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Workspace</title>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">

    <!-- Application CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/application.css">

  </head>
  <body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="navbar-header">
          <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse">
            <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
          </button>
          <a class="navbar-brand" href="/ideas">The Idea app</a>
        </div>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">

            <li class="active"><a href="/about">About Me</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="navbar-text pull-right">

      </div>
    </nav>
    <div class="container">
      <% @flash.each do |type, content| %>
        <% if content.respond_to?('each') %>
          <% content.each do |item| %>
            <%= render 'alert',
                       type:    type,
                       content: item %>
          <% end %>
        <% end %>
      <% end if @flash %>

      <%= yield %>
    </div>
    <footer>
      <div class="container">
        Rails Girls <%= Time.now.year %>
      </div>
    </footer>
    <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.0.3/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### *11a.* Commit your layout
{% highlight sh %}
git add .
git commit -m "Application layout view"
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

## *12.* Preview in a browser

In order to start the server, you need to be in the root directory of your project. Use `cd ..` repeatedly from your terminal window until you return to your workspace. Don't worry if you go back too far, simply `cd workspace` will bring you back to where you should be. Ask an instructor if unsure.

From the terminal window run the following to start the server:

{% highlight sh %}
ruby config/application.rb -p $PORT -o $IP
{% endhighlight %}

From the cloud 9 IDE click the `share` button on the right hand upper window. From the second option (`Application:`), click on the link and select the `copy` option. Then navigate to your browser and paste the url into the browser window.

<img src="/images/c9_sinatra/c9_browser.png">

You should now see the ideas app running in the browser! `ctrl+c` will terminate the server. At this stage there is a small style issue with your app, it doesn't display as well as it should. We will cover this in a following section.

## *13.* New Route and View

Generally speaking each route will have a corresponding view. Let's create a route and a view for when we are ready to create a new idea.

Open the `ideas_controller.rb` file and add the following code after the last line:

{% highlight sh %}
%w(/new /ideas/new).each do |path|
  get path do
    @title = 'New Idea'
    @idea  = Idea.new
    erb :'ideas/new'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to create the view to allow our users to add a new idea.

Navigate to the `views/ideas` folder and create a new file called `new.erb`. Add the following code:

{% highlight sh %}
<h1><%=@title %></h1>
<form action="/ideas" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <label for="idea_name">Name:</label>
  <br />
  <input id="idea_name" name="idea[name]" type="text" value="<%= @idea.name %>" />
  <br />

  <label for="idea_description">Description:</label>
  <br />
  <textarea id="idea_description" name="idea[description]" rows="5"><%= @idea.description %></textarea>
  <br />

  <label for="idea_picture">Picture:</label>
  <br />
  <input type="file" id="idea_picture" name="idea[picture]" rows="5"><%= @idea.picture %>
  <br />

  <input type="submit" value="Create Idea" />
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

Let's pause for a moment to review what we have just done. Our first step was to create a route for the `new` action. We did that in the `ideas_controller.rb` file.

We set up two variables that will be used by the `new` view, `@title` and `@idea`. `@title` is just the text that appears at the top of the web page. `@idea` is a variable that will hold all the data we will enter into our `form` and eventually insert into the database.

Finally, with the line `erb :'ideas/new'` we defined a route that will link the URL `ideas/new` to the "New Idea" view.

When the "Create Idea" button is pressed on the form, it will `POST` the form data back to our server. We need a route to consume that data and persist it to the database. Add the following route to the `ideas_controller.rb` file.

{% highlight sh %}
post '/ideas' do
  if params[:idea]
    @idea           = Idea.new(params[:idea])
    if params[:idea][:picture] && params[:idea][:picture][:filename] && params[:idea][:picture][:tempfile]
      filename      = params[:idea][:picture][:filename]
      @idea.picture = filename
      file          = params[:idea][:picture][:tempfile]
      FileUtils.copy_file(file.path,"files/#{@idea.picture}")
    end
    if @idea.save
      redirect '/ideas'
    else
      erb :'ideas/new'
    end
  else
    erb :'ideas/new'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


### *13a.* Preview in a browser
From the terminal window run the following to start the server:

{% highlight sh %}
ruby config/application.rb -p $PORT -o $IP
{% endhighlight %}

From the Cloud 9 IDE click the `share` button on the right hand upper window. From the second option (`Application:`), click on the link and select the `copy` option. Then navigate to your browser and paste the url into the browser window.

<img src="/images/c9_sinatra/c9_browser.png">

You should now see the ideas app running in the browser. ctrl + c will terminate the server.

## *14.* More routes

So now we can add an idea in our app and save it to the database. But what about retrieving an idea from the database? The next route in our application will allow us to retrieve just one idea from our database.

Navigate to `ideas_controller.rb` and enter the following route:

{% highlight sh %}
get '/ideas/:id' do
  @idea = Idea.find(params[:id])
  erb :'ideas/show'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Similar to before this route is calling `erb :'ideas/show'` so let's create that file now. Navigate to the `views/ideas` folder and create a file called `show.erb`. Add the following code:

{% highlight sh %}
<p>
  <strong>Name:</strong>
  <%= @idea.name %>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Description:</strong>
  <%= @idea.description %>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Picture:</strong>
  <%= @idea.picture if @idea.picture.present? %>
</p>
<p>
  <%= delete_idea_button(@idea.id) %>
</p>
{% endhighlight %}


## *15.* Delete routes

So now we can view a list of all our ideas, we can create a new idea, and we can view a single idea. But what if we want to delete an idea that we have previously added?

Navigate to `ideas_controller.rb` and enter the following code:

{% highlight sh %}
helpers do
  def delete_idea_button(idea_id)
    erb :'ideas/_delete_idea_button', locals: { idea_id: idea_id }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

This is called a helper route. It is referring to a view called `ideas/_delete_idea_button` so let's create that.

Navigate to the `views/ideas` folder and create a new file called `_delete_idea_button.erb`. Be sure to include the underscore.

Open the newly created file and enter the following code:

{% highlight sh %}
<form action="/ideas/<%= idea_id %>" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="delete" />
  <input type="submit" value="Delete Idea" />
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

Finally we need to create the route that will do the actual deleting. Return to the `ideas_controller.rb` file and enter the following

{% highlight sh %}
delete '/ideas/:id' do
  Idea.find(params[:id]).destroy
  redirect '/ideas'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Lets preview our changes in the browser. From the terminal window run the following to start the server:

{% highlight sh %}
ruby config/application.rb -p $PORT -o $IP
{% endhighlight %}

Note that to delete an idea, you must first open the idea (click on `Show`). From there you should see the `Delete` button.

## *16.* Updating an Idea

We are almost done! The final piece of database functionality it to retrieve a single idea and update it. As we did in the previous steps, let's start by creating a new route. Add the following code to `ideas_controller.rb`:

{% highlight sh %}
get '/ideas/:id/edit' do
  @idea = Idea.find(params[:id])
  erb :'ideas/edit'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Again we see the route is calling a view `erb :'ideas/edit'`. Let's create it by navigating to `views/ideas` and creating a file called `edit.erb` with the following code:

{% highlight sh %}
<h1>Edit Idea</h1>
<form action="/ideas/<%= @idea.id %>" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put" />

  <label for="idea_name">Name:</label>
  <br />
  <input id="idea_description" name="idea[name]" type="text" value="<%= @idea.name %>" />
  <br />

  <label for="idea_description">Description:</label>
  <br />
  <textarea id="idea_description" name="idea[description]" rows="5"><%= @idea.description %></textarea>
  <br />

  <label for="idea_picture">Picture:</label>
  <br />
  <input type="file" id="idea_picture" name="idea[picture]" rows="5"><%= @idea.picture %>
  <br />

  <input type="submit" value="Update Idea" />
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

As with the `new` action above, we know we will need to create a second route to update the database with the new data. Navigate back into `ideas_controller.rb` and add the following code:

{% highlight sh %}
put '/ideas/:id' do
  if params[:idea].try(:[], :picture)
    file      = params[:idea][:picture][:tempfile]
    @filename = params[:idea][:picture][:filename]
  end

  @idea = Idea.find(params[:id])

  if @idea.update_attributes(params[:idea])
    if @filename
      @idea.picture = @filename
      @idea.save
      File.open("./files/#{@filename}", 'wb') do |f|
        f.write(file.read)
      end
    end
    redirect "/ideas/#{@idea.id}"
  else
    erb :'ideas/edit'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Lets preview our changes in the browser. From the terminal window run the following to start the server:

{% highlight sh %}
ruby config/application.rb -p $PORT -o $IP
{% endhighlight %}

We have left out an important route for our app: managing the files we uploaded. To keep things simple let's create a new controller that will deal with the files in our app.

Navigate to the `app/controllers` folder and create a new controller called `files_controller.rb`. Add the following code to create the required routes:

{% highlight sh %}
get '/files/:filename/download' do |filename|
  send_file "./files/#{filename}", :filename => filename, :type => 'Application/octet-stream'
end

get '/files/:filename' do |filename|
  send_file "./files/#{filename}"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Let's try to download or view our files in the browser. From the terminal window run the following to start the server:

{% highlight sh %}
ruby config/application.rb -p $PORT -o $IP
{% endhighlight %}

## *17.* CSS

Lets add some css to our app.

Using the terminal window `cd` into the app folder and then do the following (again you can use the Cloud9 file explorer to create these folders)

{% highlight sh %}
mkdir app/assets
mkdir app/assets/css
touch app/assets/css/application.css
{% endhighlight %}

Lets open our newly created `application.css` file and add the following code:

{% highlight sh %}
body { padding-top: 100px; }
footer { margin-top: 100px; }
table, td, th { vertical-align: middle; border: none; color: brown; }
th { border-bottom: 1px solid #DDD; }
{% endhighlight %}

Let's preview our changes in the browser. From the terminal window run the following to start the server:

{% highlight sh %}
ruby config/application.rb -p $PORT -o $IP
{% endhighlight %}


## *18.* The End

Congratulations you have just completed your first Sinatra app!
